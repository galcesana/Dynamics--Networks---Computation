1. Simulating Language Evolution with Neural Networks

	Research NN trained on compressing colors to names.

	Train a neural network to compress sensory inputs (e.g., colors) into discrete labels under Information Bottleneck (IB) constraints.

	Research Question: Do the learned categories resemble real human language categories?

	Explore the structure of the resulting network representations and compare them to human data.

2. Extending Information Bottleneck to Other Semantic Domains

	Trying other domains rather than colors.

	Apply IB modeling to new domains like emotions, object categories, or actions.

	Research Question: Can IB explain category formation beyond colors?

3. Information Bottleneck and Cross-Linguistic Variability

	Compare languages compressing score to each color and all colors - explaining the differences, geographical difference, language age, number of speakers etc.

	Analyze how IB explains differences between languages (e.g., English vs. Amazonian languages).

	Research Question: Does the IB principle account for both universal patterns and cultural variation?



To Do List:

1. Understanding IB - Information Bottleneck method.
2. Reading related paper: Berlin B, Kay P (1969) Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution (Univ of California Press, Berkeley).
3. Finding similar paper to chosen research questions.
4. Getting data resources for the research questions.
